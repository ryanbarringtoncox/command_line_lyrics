For now, script assumes formatting of http://www.songlyrics.com/.  To rip lyrics just clone the repo and cd in.  Then run the script with url arg -

    ./lyric-scraper.py http://www.songlyrics.com/mark-mulcahy/the-rabbit-lyrics/

It will scrape the song lyrics and write them to current working dir to a text file that looks-like-this.txt.
